    "text": "Figure 1: AFINN Sentiment Scores of Inaugural Speeches Over Time.\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive bar chart displays the average AFINN sentiment score of each U.S. presidential inaugural address over time. Bars are color-coded by sentiment strength, with greener bars indicating more positive language and blue tones indicating more negative sentiment. Hovering over each bar reveals additional details, including the president’s name, year of the address, and exact sentiment score.\nWhile sentiment has remained mostly positive throughout history, we observe notably lower average sentiment during the mid-19th century, especially surrounding the Civil War era under Abraham Lincoln. A brief dip also appears in the early 20th century. More recently, sentiment peaked with George H. W. Bush’s 1989 inaugural address, which had the highest score in the dataset. Since then, average sentiment scores have gradually declined across subsequent presidencies, suggesting a rhetorical shift toward more neutral or somber tones in modern speeches.\nThe first figure uses an interactive plotly chart to allow readers to explore sentiment scores by hovering over each bar (“Plot (plotly)” n.d.). The color gradient, from blue to gray to red, was created using scale_fill_gradient2() in ggplot2 (Wickham 2024)."

You should use standard bibtex syntax for each entry, following the examples provided. If the resource you are using doesn’t already provide a way to generate a bibtex entry, I recommend using zoterobib to generate the appropriate syntax (must change the Bibliography style to “BibTeX generic citation style”). The entries currently in library.bib are intended to provide syntax examples that capture the range of entries you are most likely to use. You will need to delete and replace the contents of library.bib with your own citation entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe examples in library.bib are nicely formatted so you can read and follow the patterns, but formatting and order of the library.bib file doesn’t actually matter and will not be assessed. Just be sure the citations are as complete as possible (authors, titles, dates, urls, dois, etc.).\n\n\n@book{hadley2016,\n  author = {Hadley, Wickham}, \n  title = {ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis}, \n  url  = {https://ggplot2-book.org},\n  publisher = {Springer},\n  address = {New York, NY},\n  type = {Online book},\n  year = {2016},\n  edition = {3}\n}"
