    "text": "Figure 1: AFINN Sentiment Scores of Inaugural Speeches Over Time.\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive bar chart displays the average AFINN sentiment score of each U.S. presidential inaugural address from 1789 to 2009. The chart was created using ggplot2 with a custom blue–gray–red gradient (scale_fill_gradient2()) and made interactive using plotly, allowing readers to hover over each bar for details like president name, year, and sentiment score (“Plot (plotly)” n.d.; Wickham 2024).\nBars are color-coded by sentiment strength, with blue tones representing more positive language and red tones more negative sentiment. This helps visualize how the emotional tone of inaugural speeches has shifted over time.\nWhile sentiment has remained mostly positive throughout history, we observe notably lower average sentiment during the mid-19th century, especially surrounding the Civil War era under Abraham Lincoln. A brief dip also appears in the early 20th century. More recently, sentiment peaked with George H. W. Bush’s 1989 inaugural address — the highest score in the dataset. Since then, sentiment scores have gradually declined, suggesting a rhetorical shift toward more neutral or somber tones in modern speeches.\n\nNote: Lincoln’s relatively low sentiment score isn’t a reflection of the purpose or urgency of his speech, but likely a result of the AFINN lexicon assigning negative values to many war-related terms. For more detail on how AFINN works and why this matters, see our About page.\n\nWhile sentiment helps us understand the emotional tone of inaugural speeches, it doesn’t tell us what presidents were actually talking about. To dive deeper into the substance of presidential rhetoric, we analyzed the most common two-word phrases, or bigrams, used across six major historical eras."

You should use standard bibtex syntax for each entry, following the examples provided. If the resource you are using doesn’t already provide a way to generate a bibtex entry, I recommend using zoterobib to generate the appropriate syntax (must change the Bibliography style to “BibTeX generic citation style”).

You will need to delete and replace the contents of library.bib with your own citation entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe examples in library.bib are nicely formatted so you can read and follow the patterns, but formatting and order of the library.bib file doesn’t actually matter and will not be assessed.

Bars are color-coded by sentiment strength, with greener bars indicating more positive language and blue tones indicating more negative sentiment. Hovering over each bar reveals additional details, including the president’s name, year of the address, and exact sentiment score.\nWhile sentiment has remained mostly positive throughout history, we observe notably lower average sentiment during the mid-19th century, especially surrounding the Civil War era under Abraham Lincoln. A brief dip also appears in the early 20th century. More recently, sentiment peaked with George H. W. Bush’s 1989 inaugural address, which had the highest score in the dataset. Since then, average sentiment scores have gradually declined across subsequent presidencies, suggesting a rhetorical shift toward more neutral or somber tones in modern speeches.\nThe first figure uses an interactive plotly chart to allow readers to explore sentiment scores by hovering over each bar (“Plot (plotly)” n.d.). The color gradient, from blue to gray to red, was created using scale_fill_gradient2() in ggplot2 (Wickham 2024)."

By hovering over each bar, the user can view the president’s name, year of the inaugural address, and the Flesch-Kincaid score of the inaugural address.\nThe Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score measures the inaugural speech’s readability which accounts for both the mean sentence length and the mean syllables per word. More information on the formula will be introduced later in the blog. As for now, just know that the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score indicates what U.S. school grade level someone needs to understand the text. For instance, an 9th grader would be able to understand a text with a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score of 9.0. This means that a lower score indicates an easier inaugural speech to read while a higher score indicates a more complex inaugural speech to read.\nAs shown in Figure 4, we can observe on the bar chart how the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score decreases over time, indicating a decrease in the complexity of presidential inaugural speeches. Figure 4a displays a table ranking the five presidents with the lowest Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores between 1789 and 2009. Similarly, Figure 4b displays a table ranking the five presidents with the highest Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores. By looking at the years, we can see how the highest scores correspond to the presidents in the first two centuries while the lowest scores correspond to the presidents in the more recent centuries. This indicates that the language used in inaugural speeches has become simpler and more accessible over time."

Similarly, Figure 6 shows presidents’ first term Flesch-Kincaid score and second term Flesch-Kincaid score. By hovering over each data point, the user can view the president’s name as well as their respective scores. Each president is colored differently.\nBy examining the sentiment and Flesch-Kincaid scores across different terms, we can explore how presidential leadership and political rhetoric evolve after serving a first term. This is important because it may reveal a correlation between a president’s experience and changes in language complexity or emotional tone\nTo see this more clearly, Figure 6 displays a table showing the changes in sentiment scores and Flesch-Kincaid scores for all presidents that served two terms. This will facilitate determining whether their tone became more positive or negative and whether their language became more complex or simpler across different terms.\nSentiment Score difference:\n\nPositive Difference Value: The second-term inaugural speech was more postive than their first term inaugural speech.\nNegative Difference Value: The second-term inaugural speech was less postive or more negative than the first term inaugural speech.\nZero or close to Zero Difference Value: The sentiment/tone of the inaugural speech remained pretty consistent.\n\nFlesch-Kincaid Score Difference:\n\nPositive Difference Value: The second-term inaugural speech was more complex than the first term inaugural speech.\nNegative Difference Value: The second-term inaugural speech was simpler and easier to understand than the first term inaugural speech.\nZero or close to Zero Difference Value: The complexity of the inaugural speech remained pretty consistent."

The AFINN Lexicon assigns identified words with a value from -5 to 5, with negative scores representing negative sentiment and positive scores representing positive sentiment. We then calculated average sentiment score = (total sentiment) / (number of words recognized by AFINN). This is the average sentiment score (per word) for each speech, and it accounts for length of speech and allows for fair comparisons across speeches.\nFor the Normalized Bigram Frequency by Era, we defined six eras: “Revolution & Early Republic,” “Expansion, Reform & Civil War,” “Reconstruction to WWI,” “Interwar & WWII,” “Postwar & Civil Rights,” and “Post-Watergate to Obama.” Then, we got the got the top 8 biwords/bigrams by era with total count greater than 2. Finally, we “normalized” the counts by total bigrams per era, to allow for fair comparisons across eras, since not all eras contain the same number of bigrams.\n\n\nReadability Analysis"

    "text": "This analysis is limited by the availability and consistency of data. Four presidents (Van Buren, Buchanan, Garfield, Coolidge) were excluded due to missing transcripts. Additionally, sentiment analysis using the AFINN lexicon captures only surface-level emotional tone and may not fully reflect rhetorical nuance. Readability metrics like Flesch-Kincaid and FRE focus on sentence structure and word complexity, but not on conceptual difficulty, historical context, or rhetorical devices. Lastly, clustering results may vary depending on the selected number of clusters and do not always yield interpretable groupings."

    "text": "Future research could expand the dataset to include more recent inaugural addresses and improve sentiment analysis by incorporating lexicons better suited to political language. Topic modeling could also offer deeper insights into thematic structure. Finally, extending the analysis to other forms of presidential communication, such as State of the Union addresses or campaign speeches, could provide a more comprehensive view of rhetorical trends over time."

Finally, we “normalized” the counts by total bigrams per era, to allow for fair comparisons across eras, since not all eras contain the same number of bigrams.\n\n\nReadability Analysis\nTwo measures of readability were used: Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL)\nThe FRE measures the “readability” of a text and assigns a score that correlates to a specific level. \\[\n\\text{FRE} = 206.835 - 1.015 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Words}}{\\text{Total Sentences}} \\right) - 84.6 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Syllables}}{\\text{Total Words}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n100 - 90: 5th Grade\n90 - 80: 6th Grade\n80 - 70: 7th Grade\n70 - 60: 8th & 9th Grade\n60 - 50: 10th to 12th Grade\n50 - 30: College\n30 - 10: College Graduate\n10 - 0: Professional\n\nThe FKGL measures the U.S. reading level of a text. \\[\n\\text{FKGL} = 0.39 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Words}}{\\text{Total Sentences}} \\right) + 11.8 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Syllables}}{\\text{Total Words}} \\right) - 15.59\n\\] For example:\n\nA score of 8.0 means the average 8th grader should be able to understand it.\nA score of 12.0 suggests it matches a high school senior’s reading level.\n\n\n\nSentiment and Flesch-Kincaid Scores Difference among Presidents that Served Two Terms\nIn the Sentiment and Flesch-Kincaid Scores Change among Presidents that Served Two Terms section, Figure 12 compares sentiment scores between first and second term speeches and Figure 13 compares the Flesch-Kincaid scores between first and second term.\nFigure 13a, Differences Between Terms, displays a table showing the calculated differences of both sentiment scores and Flesch-Kincaid scores, allowing for easier comparison across presidents. Positive and negative differences are interpreted to assess whether emotional tone became more positive, negative or neutral and language complexity increased, decreased, or stayed consistent\n\n\nMean Sentence Length\nFor Mean Sentence Length over time, we calculate the number of words per sentence throughout the entire presidential inaugural speech to obtain the mean sentence length. By measuring the mean sentence length of an speech, we can get a rough idea of how complex the speech’s sentences are. It is important to note that the mean sentence length measures the complexity of the sentence structure based on its length, but it doesn’t measure the complexity of each individual word. For Mean Sentence Length vs. Sentiment, K-means clustering was used to identify distinct groupings of presidential inaugural speeches based on sentence structure complexity (mean sentence length) and emotional tone (average sentiment score), making it easier to spot patterns in speech style and emotion.\n\nNote: We didn’t include these two plots involing mean sentence length on the main page because it didn’t seem as relevant. However, we still thought to show them in the appendix to provide additional insight."

    "text": "Understanding the relationship: Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) & Flesch-Kincaid Grading Level (FKGL)\nTo get a better understanding of the relationship between the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), it is helpful to plot them together on a scatterplot.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: This chart displays the inverse relationship between the Flesch-Kincaid and Flesch Reading Ease formulas.\n\n\n\n\nThe FRE and the FKGL have an inverse relationship because they are based on similar textual features—sentence length and word complexity—but use opposing scales to express readability.\n\\[\n\\text{FRE} = 206.835 - 1.015 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Words}}{\\text{Total Sentences}} \\right) - 84.6 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Syllables}}{\\text{Total Words}} \\right)\n\\] \\[\n\\text{FKGL} = 0.39 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Words}}{\\text{Total Sentences}} \\right) + 11.8 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Syllables}}{\\text{Total Words}} \\right) - 15.59\n\\]\nAs sentence length and syllables per word increase, FRE scores decrease (the text becomes harder to read), while FKGL scores increase (the grade level rises). This opposing behavior is why they have an inverse relationship: when one goes up, the other tends to go down."
